  "info.signpic.help": "This mod provides a way for images from the internet to be displayed in the world.\nTo create a SignPicture, unlike how you did in 1.12, you will need to type the sign yourself.\nAll 4 lines in the sign are treated as a single command, and all line separators are ignored.\nThe syntax for the sign is #<link>{<Image Width>x<Image Height>, <Width Offset>x<Height Offset>}\nThe link is without the HTTP or HTTPS prefix. If you need to use HTTPS, add a $ after #.\nIf you place a standing sign that needs to display vertically, add ‘R’ after Height Offset.\nFinally, if signs are not updating, try placing another sign first.\nFeel free to experiment with the mod, and have fun using it!",
