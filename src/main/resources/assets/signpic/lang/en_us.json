  "info.signpic.help": "- This mod provides a way for images from the internet to be displayed in the world.\n\n- To create a SignPicture, unlike how you did in 1.12, you will need to type the sign yourself.\n\n- All 4 lines in the sign are treated as a single command, and all line separators are ignored.\n\n- The syntax for the sign is #<link>{<Image Width>x<Image Height>, <Width Offset>x<Height Offset>}\n\n- The link should be a direct link to the image without the HTTP or HTTPS prefix. If you need to use HTTPS, add a $ after #.\n\n- If you place a standing sign that needs to display vertically, add ‘R’ after Height Offset.\n\n- Finally, if signs are not updating, try placing another sign first.\n\n- Feel free to experiment with the mod, and have fun using it!",
