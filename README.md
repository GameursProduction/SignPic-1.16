# SignPic 1.16

`This is a complete re-code of the old mod, and has no relation with the old mod.`

This is a complete remake of the mod [SignPicture](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/signpicture) for Minecraft Version 1.16.4/1.16.5,
which allows images from the internet to be rendered in world through a Sign.

## Difference with 1.12
- In 1.12, you could use the GUI (backslash key) to place the sign for you, but you will need to type the sign yourself in 1.16.
- This mod (should ?) support all types of signs and wall-sign since Minecraft introduced other types of Signs in 1.13.

## How to use
- The same guide could be found pressing the "info.signpic.help" key (Default: F12) in game.

>- This mod provides a way for images from the internet to be displayed in the world.
>- To create a SignPicture, unlike how you did in 1.12, you will need to type the sign yourself.
>- All 4 lines in the sign are treated as a single command, and all line separators are ignored.
>- The syntax for the sign is `#<link>{<Image Width>x<Image Height>, <Width Offset>x<Height Offset>}`.
>- The link should be a direct link to the image without the HTTP or HTTPS prefix. If you need to use HTTPS, add a $ after #.
>- If you place a standing sign that needs to display vertically, add ‘R’ after Height Offset.
>- Finally, if signs are not updating, try placing another sign first.
>- Feel free to experiment with the mod, and have fun using it!

## FAQ

- Will you be porting it to 1.17 or above? Depends on the reaction and demand of this mod, but very possible.
